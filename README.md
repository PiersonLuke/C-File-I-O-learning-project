# Student Records Manager (C)

A simple C program that collects student information from user input, writes it to a text file, and then reads the data back for display. This project was created to practice file I/O, and user input handling.

## What I Learned

Reading and writing files in C

Handling mixed input (scanf + fgets)

Formatting output for readability
